# Video Player with Cues

This is the Vimeo player with Cues added.

## Installation

I used Yarn so both that and NPM can be used:

```bash
yarn install
```

or

```bash
npm install
```

## Usage

Build and start server:

```bash
npm start
```

Build only:

```bash
npm run build
```

The page will load video id 76979871 by default if no video is set in the url. Videos can be changed by changing the url parameter:

```
http://localhost:8080/?id=VIDEO_ID_HERE
```
